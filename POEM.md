**After 5,000 lbs of premium gabagool**

From the corner booth, Tony lights a cigar and Tim cracks a grin.

Tony: "We build things that work. We make 'em fast, we make 'em quiet, and we make sure they don't get pinched. You keep the numbers honest, I keep the streets honest."

Tim: "Call it Gaba Burn. It's the only framework with street legality. You run it local, you own the data, you keep your secrets. No backdoors, no surprises."

Together, they raise a glass of gabagool and sign the contract with a handshake: code that ships, kernels that hum, a runtime that respects the rules of the family.
