# Importing Models

Burn supports importing models from other frameworks and file formats, enabling you to use
pre-trained weights in your Burn applications.

## Supported Formats

| Format | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| [**ONNX**](./onnx-model.md) | Open Neural Network Exchange format | Direct import of complete model architectures and weights from any framework that supports ONNX export |

For loading PyTorch (`.pt`, `.pth`) and SafeTensors (`.safetensors`) model weights, see the
[Saving and Loading Models](../saving-and-loading.md) chapter.
