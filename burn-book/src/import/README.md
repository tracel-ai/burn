# Importing Models

The Burn project supports the import of models from various frameworks, emphasizing efficiency and
compatibility. Currently, it handles two primary model formats:

1. [ONNX](./onnx-model): Facilitates direct import, ensuring the model's performance and structural
   integrity are maintained.

2. [PyTorch](./pytorch-model): Enables the loading of PyTorch model weights into Burn’s native model
   architecture, ensuring seamless integration.
