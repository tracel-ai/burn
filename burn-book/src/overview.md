# Overview

Welcome to The Burn Book ðŸ‘‹

This book will help you get started with the Burn deep learning framework, whether you are an
advanced user or a beginner. We have crafted some sections for you:

- [Basic Workflow: From Training to Inference](./basic-workflow): We'll start with the fundamentals,
  guiding you through the entire workflow, from training your models to deploying them for
  inference. This section lays the groundwork for your Burn expertise.

- [Building Blocks](./building-blocks): Dive deeper into Burn's core components, understanding how
  they fit together. This knowledge forms the basis for more advanced usage and customization.

- [Performance - Good Practices](./performance/good-practices/): Tips for writing models and
