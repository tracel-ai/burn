**Burn is a next generation Deep Learning Framework that doesn't compromise on <br /> flexibility,
efficiency and portability.**

## Performance

<div align="left">
<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-blazingly-fast.png" height="96px"/>

Because we believe the goal of a deep learning framework is to convert computation into useful
intelligence, we have made performance a core pillar of Burn. We strive to achieve top efficiency by
leveraging multiple optimization techniques described below.

**Click on each section for more details** üëá

</div>

<br />

<details>
<summary>
Automatic kernel fusion üí•
</summary>
<br />

Using Burn means having your models optimized on any backend. When possible, we provide a way to
automatically and dynamically create custom kernels that minimize data relocation between different
memory spaces, extremely useful when moving memory is the bottleneck.

As an example, you could write your own GELU activation function with the high level tensor api (see
Rust code snippet below).

```rust
fn gelu_custom<B: Backend, const D: usize>(x: Tensor<B, D>) -> Tensor<B, D> {
    let x = x.clone() * ((x / SQRT_2).erf() + 1);
    x / 2
}
```

Then, at runtime, a custom low-level kernel will be automatically created for your specific
implementation and will rival a handcrafted GPU implementation. The kernel consists of about 60
lines of WGSL [WebGPU Shading Language]("https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/"),
an extremely verbose lower level shader language you probably don't want to program your deep
learning models in!

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Asynchronous execution ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
</summary>
<br />

For [first-party backends](#backends), an asynchronous execution style is used, which allows to
perform various optimizations, such as the previously mentioned automatic kernel fusion.

Asynchronous execution also ensures that the normal execution of the framework does not block the
model computations, which implies that the framework overhead won't impact the speed of execution
significantly. Conversely, the intense computations in the model do not interfere with the
responsiveness of the framework. For more information about our asynchronous backends, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Thread-safe building blocks ü¶û
</summary>
<br />

Burn emphasizes thread safety by leveraging the
[ownership system of Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html).
With Burn, each module is the owner of its weights. It is therefore possible to send a module to
another thread for computing the gradients, then send the gradients to the main thread that can
aggregate them, and _voil√†_, you get multi-device training.

This is a very different approach from what PyTorch does, where backpropagation actually mutates the
_grad_ attribute of each tensor parameter. This is not a thread-safe operation and therefore
requires lower level synchronization primitives, see
[distributed training](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html) for reference. Note that
this is still very fast, but not compatible across different backends and quite hard to implement.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Intelligent memory management ü¶Ä
</summary>
<br />

One of the main roles of a deep learning framework is to reduce the amount of memory necessary to
run models. The naive way of handling memory is that each tensor has its own memory space, which is
allocated when the tensor is created then deallocated as the tensor gets out of scope. However,
allocating and deallocating data is very costly, so a memory pool is often required to achieve good
throughput. Burn offers an infrastructure that allows for easily creating and selecting memory
management strategies for backends. For more details on memory management in Burn, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

Another very important memory optimization of Burn is that we keep track of when a tensor can be
mutated in-place just by using the ownership system well. Even though it is a rather small memory
optimization on its own, it adds up considerably when training or running inference with larger
models and contributes to reduce the memory usage even more. For more information, see
[this blog post about tensor handling](https://burn.dev/blog/burn-rusty-approach-to-tensor-handling).

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Automatic kernel selection üéØ
</summary>
<br />

A good deep learning framework should ensure that models run smoothly on all hardware. However, not
all hardware share the same behavior in terms of execution speed. For instance, a matrix
multiplication kernel can be launched with many different parameters, which are highly sensitive to
the size of the matrices and the hardware. Using the wrong configuration could reduce the speed of
execution by a large factor (10 times or even more in extreme cases), so choosing the right kernels
becomes a priority.

With our home-made backends, we run benchmarks automatically and choose the best configuration for
the current hardware and matrix sizes with a reasonable caching strategy.

This adds a small overhead by increasing the warmup execution time, but stabilizes quickly after a
few forward and backward passes, saving lots of time in the long run. Note that this feature isn't
mandatory, and can be disabled when cold starts are a priority over optimized throughput.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Hardware specific features üî•
</summary>
<br />

It is no secret that deep learning is mostly relying on matrix multiplication as its core operation,
since this is how fully-connected neural networks are modeled.

More and more, hardware manufacturers optimize their chips specifically for matrix multiplication
workloads. For instance, Nvidia has its _Tensor Cores_ and today most cellphones have AI specialized
chips. As of this moment, we support Tensor Cores with our LibTorch, Candle, CUDA, Metal and
WGPU/SPIR-V backends, but not other accelerators yet. We hope
[this issue](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4195) gets resolved at some point to bring
support to our WGPU backend.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Custom Backend Extension üéí
</summary>
<br />

Burn aims to be the most flexible deep learning framework. While it's crucial to maintain
compatibility with a wide variety of backends, Burn also provides the ability to extend the
functionalities of a backend implementation to suit your personal modeling requirements.

This versatility is advantageous in numerous ways, such as supporting custom operations like flash
attention or manually writing your own kernel for a specific backend to enhance performance. See
[this section](https://burn.dev/books/burn/advanced/backend-extension/index.html) in the Burn Book
üî• for more details.

</details>

<br />

## Backend

<div align="left">
<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/backend-chip.png" height="96px"/>

Burn strives to be as fast as possible on as many hardwares as possible, with robust
implementations. We believe this flexibility is crucial for modern needs where you may train your
models in the cloud, then deploy on customer hardwares, which vary from user to user.

</div>

<br />

**Supported Backends**

| Backend  | Devices                      | Class       |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| CUDA     | NVIDIA GPUs                  | First-Party |
| ROCm     | AMD GPUs                     | First-Party |
| Metal    | Apple GPUs                   | First-Party |
| Vulkan   | Most GPUs on Linux & Windows | First-Party |
| Wgpu     | Most GPUs                    | First-Party |
| NdArray  | Most CPUs                    | Third-Party |
| LibTorch | Most GPUs & CPUs             | Third-Party |
| Candle   | Nvidia, Apple GPUs & CPUs    | Third-Party |

<br />

Compared to other frameworks, Burn has a very different approach to supporting many backends. By
design, most code is generic over the Backend trait, which allows us to build Burn with swappable
backends. This makes composing backend possible, augmenting them with additional functionalities
such as autodifferentiation and automatic kernel fusion.

<details>
<summary>
Autodiff: Backend decorator that brings backpropagation to any backend üîÑ
</summary>
<br />

Contrary to the aforementioned backends, Autodiff is actually a backend _decorator_. This means that
it cannot exist by itself; it must encapsulate another backend.

The simple act of wrapping a base backend with Autodiff transparently equips it with
autodifferentiation support, making it possible to call backward on your model.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff<Wgpu>;

    let device = Default::default();

    let x: Tensor<Backend, 2> = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default, &device);
    let y: Tensor<Backend, 2> = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default, &device).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&grads).unwrap();
    println!("{y_grad}");
}
```

Of note, it is impossible to make the mistake of calling backward on a model that runs on a backend
that does not support autodiff (for inference), as this method is only offered by an Autodiff
backend.

See the [Autodiff Backend README](./crates/burn-autodiff/README.md) for more details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Fusion: Backend decorator that brings kernel fusion to all first-party backends
</summary>
<br />

This backend decorator enhances a backend with kernel fusion, provided that the inner backend
supports it. Note that you can compose this backend with other backend decorators such as Autodiff.
All first-party accelerated backends (like WGPU and CUDA) use Fusion by default (`burn/fusion`
feature flag), so you typically don't need to apply it manually.

```rust
#[cfg(not(feature = "fusion"))]
pub type Cuda<F = f32, I = i32> = CubeBackend<CudaRuntime, F, I, u8>;

#[cfg(feature = "fusion")]
pub type Cuda<F = f32, I = i32> = burn_fusion::Fusion<CubeBackend<CudaRuntime, F, I, u8>>;
```

Of note, we plan to implement automatic gradient checkpointing based on compute bound and memory
bound operations, which will work gracefully with the fusion backend to make your code run even
faster during training, see [this issue](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/issues/936).

See the [Fusion Backend README](./crates/burn-fusion/README.md) for more details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Router (Beta): Backend decorator that composes multiple backends into a single one
</summary>
<br />

That backend simplifies hardware operability, if for instance you want to execute some operations on
the CPU and other operations on the GPU.

```rust
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};
use burn::backend::{
    NdArray, Router, Wgpu, ndarray::NdArrayDevice, router::duo::MultiDevice, wgpu::WgpuDevice,
};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Router<(Wgpu, NdArray)>;

    let device_0 = MultiDevice::B1(WgpuDevice::DiscreteGpu(0));
    let device_1 = MultiDevice::B2(NdArrayDevice::Cpu);

    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::<Backend, 2>::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &device_0);
    let tensor_cpu =
        Tensor::<Backend, 2>::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &device_1);
}

```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Remote (Beta): Backend decorator for remote backend execution, useful for distributed computations
</summary>
<br />

That backend has two parts, one client and one server. The client sends tensor operations over the
network to a remote compute backend. You can use any first-party backend as server in a single line
of code:

```rust
fn main_server() {
    // Start a server on port 3000.
    burn::server::start::<burn::backend::Cuda>(Default::default(), 3000);
}

fn main_client() {
    // Create a client that communicate with the server on port 3000.
    use burn::backend::{Autodiff, RemoteBackend};

    type Backend = Autodiff<RemoteDevice>;

    let device = RemoteDevice::new("ws://localhost:3000");
    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::<Backend, 2>::random([3, 3], Distribution::Default, &device);
}

```

## Training & Inference

<div align="left">
<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-wall.png" height="96px"/>

The whole deep learning workflow is made easy with Burn, as you can monitor your training progress
with an ergonomic dashboard, and run inference everywhere from embedded devices to large GPU
clusters.

Burn was built from the ground up with training and inference in mind. It's also worth noting how
Burn, in comparison to frameworks like PyTorch, simplifies the transition from training to
deployment, eliminating the need for code changes.

Training Dashboard üìà
</summary>
<br />

As you can see in the previous video (click on the picture!), a new terminal UI dashboard based on
the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate allows users to follow their training
with ease without having to connect to any external application.

You can visualize your training and validation metrics updating in real-time and analyze the
lifelong progression or recent history of any registered metrics using only the arrow keys. Break
from the training loop without crashing, allowing potential checkpoints to be fully written or
important pieces of code to complete without interruption üõ°

</details>

<details>
<summary>
ONNX Support üê´
</summary>
<br />

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open-standard format that exports both the architecture
and the weights of a deep learning model.

Burn supports the importation of models that follow the ONNX standard so you can easily port a model
you have written in another framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to Burn to benefit from all the
advantages our framework offers.

Our ONNX support is further described in
[this section of the Burn Book üî•](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/onnx-model.html).

> **Note**: This crate is in active development and currently supports a
> [limited set of ONNX operators](./crates/burn-import/SUPPORTED-ONNX-OPS.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Importing PyTorch or Safetensors Models üöö
</summary>
<br />

You can load weights from PyTorch or Safetensors formats directly into your Burn-defined models.
This makes it easy to reuse existing models while benefiting from Burn's performance and deployment
features.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Inference in the Browser üåê
</summary>
<br />

Several of our backends can run in WebAssembly environments: Candle and NdArray for CPU execution,
and WGPU for GPU acceleration via WebGPU. This means that you can run inference directly within a
browser. We provide several examples of this:

- [MNIST](./examples/mnist-inference-web) where you can draw digits and a small convnet tries to
  find which one it is! 2Ô∏è‚É£ 7Ô∏è‚É£ üò∞
- [Image Classification](./examples/image-classification-web) where you can upload images and
  classify them! üåÑ

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Embedded: <i>no_std</i> support ‚öôÔ∏è
</summary>
<br />

Burn's core components support [no_std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html). This
means it can run in bare metal environment such as embedded devices without an operating system.

> As of now, only the NdArray backend can be used in a _no_std_ environment.

</details>

<br />

### Benchmarks

To evaluate performance across different backends and track improvements over time, we provide a
dedicated benchmarking suite.

Run and compare benchmarks using [burn-bench](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-bench).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning** When using one of the `wgpu` backends, you may encounter compilation errors related
> to recursive type evaluation. This is due to complex type nesting within the `wgpu` dependency
> chain. To resolve this issue, add the following line at the top of your `main.rs` or `lib.rs`
> file:
>
> ```rust
> #![recursion_limit = "256"]
> ```
>
> The default recursion limit (128) is often just below the required depth (typically 130-150) due
> to deeply nested associated types and trait bounds.

The Burn Book üî•
</summary>
<br />

To begin working effectively with Burn, it is crucial to understand its key components and
philosophy. This is why we highly recommend new users to read the first sections of
[The Burn Book üî•](https://burn.dev/books/burn/). It provides detailed examples and explanations
covering every facet of the framework, including building blocks like tensors, modules, and
optimizers, all the way to advanced usage, like coding your own GPU kernels.

> The project is constantly evolving, and we try as much as possible to keep the book up to date

<details>
<summary>
Examples üôè
</summary>
<br />

Let's start with a code snippet that shows how intuitive the framework is to use! In the following,
we declare a neural network module with some parameters along with its forward pass.

```rust
use burn::nn;
use burn::module::Module;
use burn::tensor::backend::Backend;

#[derive(Module, Debug)]
pub struct PositionWiseFeedForward<B: Backend> {
    linear_inner: nn::Linear<B>,
    linear_outer: nn::Linear<B>,
    dropout: nn::Dropout,
    gelu: nn::Gelu,
}

impl<B: Backend> PositionWiseFeedForward<B> {
    pub fn forward<const D: usize>(&self, input: Tensor<B, D>) -> Tensor<B, D> {
        let x = self.linear_inner.forward(input);
        let x = self.gelu.forward(x);
        let x = self.dropout.forward(x);

        self.linear_outer.forward(x)
    }
}
```

Why use Rust for Deep Learning? ü¶Ä
</summary>
<br />

Deep Learning is a special form of software where you need very high level abstractions as well as
extremely fast execution time. Rust is the perfect candidate for that use case since it provides
zero-cost abstractions to easily create neural network modules, and fine-grained control over memory
to optimize every detail.

It's important that a framework be easy to use at a high level so that its users can focus on
innovating in the AI field. However, since running models relies so heavily on computations,
performance can't be neglected.

To this day, the mainstream solution to this problem has been to offer APIs in Python, but rely on
bindings to low-level languages such as C/C++. This reduces portability, increases complexity and
creates frictions between researchers and engineers. We feel like Rust's approach to abstractions
makes it versatile enough to tackle this two languages dichotomy.

Rust also comes with the Cargo package manager, which makes it incredibly easy to build, test, and
deploy from any environment, which is usually a pain in Python.

Although Rust has the reputation of being a difficult language at first, we strongly believe it
leads to more reliable, bug-free solutions built faster (after some practice üòÖ)!

Loading Model Records From Previous Versions ‚ö†Ô∏è
</summary>
<br />

In the event that you are trying to load a model record saved in a version older than `0.14.0`, make
sure to use a compatible version (`0.14`, `0.15` or `0.16`) with the `record-backward-compat`
feature flag.

```
features = [..., "record-backward-compat"]
```

Otherwise, the record won't be deserialized correctly and you will get an error message. This error
will also point you to the backward compatible feature flag.

The backward compatibility was maintained for deserialization when loading records. Therefore, as
soon as you have saved the record again it will be saved according to the new structure and you can
upgrade back to the current version

Please note that binary formats are not backward compatible. Thus, you will need to load your record
in a previous version and save it in any of the other self-describing record format (e.g., using the
`NamedMpkFileRecorder`) before using a compatible version (as described) with the
`record-backward-compat` feature flag.
