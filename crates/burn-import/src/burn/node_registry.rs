// This file contains the master registry of all ONNX operations supported by
// burn-import. The `node_registry!` macro auto-generates all conversion logic.
//
// # How to Add a New Operation
//
// 1. Implement the node in `src/burn/node/<operation>.rs`:
//    - Create `<Operation>Node` struct
//    - Implement `OnnxIntoNode::from_onnx()` to convert from ONNX IR
//    - Implement `NodeCodegen` trait for code generation
//
// 2. Add module declaration in `src/burn/mod.rs`:
//    ```rust
//    pub(crate) mod node {
//        // ...
//        pub(crate) mod <operation>;
//    }
//    ```
//
// 3. Add ONE line to this registry:
//
//    For single ONNX op → single node type:
//    ```rust
//    <OnnxOp> => <module> as <NodeType>,
//    ```
//
//    For multiple ONNX ops → single node type:
//    ```rust
//    [<Op1>, <Op2>, <Op3>] => <Variant>: <module> as <NodeType>,
//    ```
// See `registry_macro.rs` for detailed documentation of the macro itself.
