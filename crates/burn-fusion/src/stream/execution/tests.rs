//! A testing module that ensures the correctness of the explorer, policy, and processor.
//!
//! The primary focus is on validating the seamless interaction between these three components to
//! execute and optimize a stream of operations accurately.
//!
//! To test these components effectively, we create mock types for the stream, optimization,
//! optimization builder, and stream segment. These mock types aid in comprehensively
//! understanding the process of optimizing streams.
