# Burn Standard Library

`burn-std` provides the core types and utilities shared across the Burn ecosystem.  
It includes foundational definitions for shapes, indexing, and data types.

This crate supports both `std` and `no_std` environments and must compile with
`cargo build --no-default-features` as well.
