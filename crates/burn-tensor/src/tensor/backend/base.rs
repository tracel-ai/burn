/// This trait defines all types and functions needed for a backend to be used with burn.
///
/// ## Design
///
/// This trait aims to be as unopinionated as possible and allows implementations to define
/// their own types and patterns. Therefore, there are few pre-defined abstractions baked
/// into this trait.
///
/// Backends must define their own tensor types for each data type: `float`, `int`, and `bool`.
/// Since we minimize assumptions, we chose to separate these types, as they are used in
/// different contexts. However, some backends may have a generic tensor type that is used
/// for all data types.
///
/// ### Eager Mode
///
/// Because burn supports dynamic graphs, the backend trait is designed around kernel
/// implementations that can be called without any mutable context or graph. This may not be
/// ideal for backends that want to configure their computational graphs and execute them
/// multiple times.
///
/// To implement this kind of backend, channels could be used to communicate with a backend
/// server thread to build the computation graphs and re-execute the ones that are repeated,
/// with some form of cache. Once that pattern has matured, a graph mode backend trait could
/// be extracted from it, allowing other backends of the same kind to be quickly integrated
/// with burn. This pattern could also be used to create an operation fusion trait, which
/// allows backends to define what kind of graph structures can be fused into one operation.
///
/// ### Multi-Threaded
///
/// Backend tensor types are all `Clone` + `Send`, which allows them to be safely
/// sent between threads. It is recommended to wrap tensors with [Arc](alloc::sync::Arc),
/// which avoids copying the tensor's buffer. Note that it is still possible to mutate and
/// reuse tensors' buffer without locking; see the next section on the Mutable API.
///
/// ### Mutable API
///
/// There is no mutable or inplace operation API to implement, but that does not mean that
/// backends cannot support them. Using [try_unwrap](alloc::sync::Arc::try_unwrap) and
/// [get_mut](alloc::sync::Arc::get_mut) allows backends to have access to an owned or mutable
/// reference to their tensor buffer data structure if the tensor is not shared. In that case,
/// backends can dispatch to their owned inplace operations for better performance.
///
/// ## Documentation
///
/// Most of the documentation for each function can be found on the user API [tensor struct](crate::Tensor).
/// For modules, public functions are often created, which can be used by `burn-core` modules.
