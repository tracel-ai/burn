# Burn Torch Backend

[Burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) Torch backend

[![Current Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/burn-tch.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/burn-tch)
[![license](https://shields.io/badge/license-MIT%2FApache--2.0-blue)](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-tch/blob/master/README.md)

This crate provides a Torch backend for [Burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) utilizing the
[`tch-rs`](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs) crate, which offers a Rust interface to the
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) C++ API.

The backend supports CPU (multithreaded), [CUDA](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html)
(multiple GPUs), and [MPS](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/mps.html) devices (MacOS).

## Installation

[`tch-rs`](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs) requires the C++ PyTorch library (LibTorch) to
be available on your system.

By default, the CPU distribution is installed for LibTorch v2.9.0 as required by `tch-rs`.

<details>
<summary><strong>CUDA</strong></summary>

To install the latest compatible CUDA distribution, set the `TORCH_CUDA_VERSION` environment
variable before the `tch-rs` dependency is retrieved with `cargo`.

```shell
export TORCH_CUDA_VERSION=cu128
```

On Windows:

```powershell
$Env:TORCH_CUDA_VERSION = "cu128"
```

> Note: `tch` doesn't expose the downloaded libtorch directory on Windows when using the automatic
> download feature, so the `torch_cuda.dll` cannot be detected properly during build. In this case,
> you can set the `LIBTORCH` environment variable to point to the `libtorch/` folder in `torch-sys`
> `OUT_DIR` (or move the downloaded lib to a different folder and point to it).

For example, running the validation sample for the first time could be done with the following
commands:

```shell
export TORCH_CUDA_VERSION=cu128
cargo run --bin cuda --release
```

**Important:** make sure your driver version is compatible with the selected CUDA version. A CUDA
Toolkit installation is not required since LibTorch ships with the appropriate CUDA runtimes. Having
the latest driver version is recommended, but you can always take a look at the
[toolkit driver version table](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html#id4)
or
[minimum required driver version](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html#minor-version-compatibility)
(limited feature-set, might not work with all operations).

</details><br>

Once your installation is complete, you should be able to build/run your project. You can also
validate your installation by running the appropriate `cpu`, `cuda` or `mps` sample as below.

```shell
cargo run --bin cpu --release
cargo run --bin cuda --release
cargo run --bin mps --release
```

_Note: no MPS distribution is available for automatic download at this time, please check out the
[manual instructions](#metal-mps)._

### Manual Download

To install `tch-rs` with a different LibTorch distribution, you will have to manually download the
desired LibTorch distribution. The instructions are detailed in the sections below for each
platform.

<sup><a id="cpu-sup">[1]</a> The LibTorch CUDA distribution also comes with CPU support.</sup>

#### CPU

<details open>
<summary><strong>üêß Linux</strong></summary>

First, download the LibTorch CPU distribution.

```shell
wget -O libtorch.zip https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cpu/libtorch-shared-with-deps-2.9.0%2Bcpu.zip
unzip libtorch.zip
```

Then, point to that installation using the `LIBTORCH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables
before building `burn-tch` or a crate which depends on it.

```shell
export LIBTORCH=/absolute/path/to/libtorch/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/absolute/path/to/libtorch/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

</details><br>

<details>
<summary><strong>üçé Mac</strong></summary>

First, download the LibTorch CPU distribution.

```shell
wget -O libtorch.zip https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cpu/libtorch-macos-arm64-2.9.0.zip
unzip libtorch.zip
```

Then, point to that installation using the `LIBTORCH` and `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables
before building `burn-tch` or a crate which depends on it.

```shell
export LIBTORCH=/absolute/path/to/libtorch/
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/absolute/path/to/libtorch/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

</details><br>

<details>
<summary><strong>ü™ü Windows</strong></summary>

First, download the LibTorch CPU distribution.

```powershell
wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cpu/libtorch-win-shared-with-deps-2.9.0%2Bcpu.zip -OutFile libtorch.zip
Expand-Archive libtorch.zip
```

Then, set the `LIBTORCH` environment variable and append the library to your path as with the
PowerShell commands below before building `burn-tch` or a crate which depends on it.

```powershell
$Env:LIBTORCH = "/absolute/path/to/libtorch/"
$Env:Path += ";/absolute/path/to/libtorch/"
```

</details><br>

#### CUDA

LibTorch 2.9.0 currently includes binary distributions with CUDA 12.6, 12.8 or 13.0 runtimes. The
manual installation instructions are detailed below for CUDA 12.6, but can be applied to the other
CUDA versions by replacing `cu126` with the corresponding version string (e.g., `cu130`).

<details open>
<summary><strong>üêß Linux</strong></summary>

First, download the LibTorch CUDA 12.6 distribution.

```shell
wget -O libtorch.zip https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu126/libtorch-shared-with-deps-2.9.0%2Bcu126.zip
unzip libtorch.zip
```

Then, point to that installation using the `LIBTORCH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables
before building `burn-tch` or a crate which depends on it.

```shell
export LIBTORCH=/absolute/path/to/libtorch/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/absolute/path/to/libtorch/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

**Note:** make sure your CUDA installation is in your `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

</details><br>

<details>
<summary><strong>ü™ü Windows</strong></summary>

First, download the LibTorch CUDA 12.6 distribution.

```powershell
wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu126/libtorch-win-shared-with-deps-2.9.0%2Bcu126.zip -OutFile libtorch.zip
Expand-Archive libtorch.zip
```

Then, set the `LIBTORCH` environment variable and append the library to your path as with the
PowerShell commands below before building `burn-tch` or a crate which depends on it.

```powershell
$Env:LIBTORCH = "/absolute/path/to/libtorch/"
$Env:Path += ";/absolute/path/to/libtorch/"
```

</details><br>

#### Metal (MPS)

There is no official LibTorch distribution with MPS support at this time, so the easiest alternative
is to use a PyTorch installation. This requires a Python installation.

_Note: MPS acceleration is available on MacOS 12.3+._

```shell
pip install torch==2.9.0 numpy==1.26.4 setuptools
export LIBTORCH_USE_PYTORCH=1
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/pytorch/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

**Note:** if `venv` is used, it should be activated during coding and building, or the compiler may
not work properly.

## Example Usage

For a simple example, check out any of the test programs in [`src/bin/`](./src/bin/). Each program
sets the device to use and performs a simple element-wise addition.

For a more complete example using the `tch` backend, take a loot at the
[Burn mnist example](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/tree/main/examples/mnist).

## Too many environment variables?

Try `.cargo/config.toml` ([cargo book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#env)).

Instead of setting the environments in your shell, you can manually add them to your
`.cargo/config.toml`:

```toml
[env]
LD_LIBRARY_PATH = "/absolute/path/to/libtorch/lib"
LIBTORCH = "/absolute/path/to/libtorch/libtorch"
```

Or use bash commands below:

```bash
mkdir .cargo
cat <<EOF > .cargo/config.toml
[env]
LD_LIBRARY_PATH = "/absolute/path/to/libtorch/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
LIBTORCH = "/absolute/path/to/libtorch/libtorch"
EOF
```

This will automatically include the old `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` value in the new one.
