# ONNX to Burn: Development Guide

This guide offers in-depth design insights and step-by-step procedures for developers working on the
ONNX to Burn conversion tool. This tool allows the importation of ONNX models into the Burn deep
learning framework written in Rust. It converts both ONNX models to Rust source code and model
weights to Burn state files.

For an introduction to ONNX import in Burn, see
[this section of the Burn book](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/onnx-model.html).

## Design Overview

### Design Goals

- Perform best-effort conversion of ONNX models to Rust source code via Burn APIs.
- Convert ONNX model weights to Burn state files.
- Support ONNX models generated by PyTorch (ONNX Opset 16+).
- Produce easy-to-understand and modifiable models.
- Ensure the generated models are trainable using Burn APIs.

### Design Decisions

**Core Principles:**

- **Op/Node-Centric Design**: Built around individual operations and nodes for better scalability as
  more operators are added
- **Opset-Aware Processing**: Processors accept opset parameters for flexible behavior across
  different ONNX versions
- **Constants-First Approach**: All ONNX initializers are treated as constant nodes initially,
  providing a uniform starting point
- **Native Type Integration**: Direct use of `burn_tensor::TensorData` and `Dtype` for efficiency,
  consistency, and future mmap support
- **Multi-Phase Pipeline**: Explicit transformation phases (initialization → conversion → type
  inference → post-processing → finalization) for better visibility and maintainability
- **Graph Input Name Preservation**: Sanitized ONNX names are preserved for easier development and
  troubleshooting

**Separation of Concerns:**

- Limit interaction with ONNX to the Intermediate Representation (IR) stage to simplify the process
- Ensure operator behavior consistency across different OpSet versions
- Exclude any ONNX/Protobuf-specific logic from the Burn graph

The conversion process involves three main stages:

1. Convert ONNX model to Intermediate Representation (IR) via 5-phase pipeline.
2. Translate IR to a Burn graph.
3. Generate Rust source code from the Burn graph.

## Adding New Operators

To extend `burn-import` with support for new ONNX operators, follow these steps:

1. **Create PyTorch Script**: Place a PyTorch script using the new operator under
   `crates/burn-import/onnx-tests/tests/<op>/<op>.py`. Make sure to print both input and output
   tensors for end-to-end testing.

2. **Generate ONNX Model**: Run the PyTorch script to produce an ONNX model.

3. **Visualize ONNX Model**: Use [Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron) to verify the ONNX
   model contains the expected operators.

4. **Generate IR and Burn Graph**: Navigate to
   [crates/burn-import/](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/tree/main/crates/burn-import) and run:

   ```
   cargo r -- ./onnx-tests/tests/<op>/<op>.onnx ./out
   ```

5. **Implement Missing Operators**: If you encounter an error stating that an operator is
   unsupported, [implement it](#implementing-a-new-operator). The `./out/my-model.graph.txt` should
   provide relevant information.

6. **Inspect Generated Files**: The `my-model.graph.txt` contains IR details, `my-model.rs` holds
   the Burn model in Rust code, and `my-model.json` includes the model data.

7. **Add End-to-End Test**: Include the test in
   [crates/burn-import/onnx-tests/tests/test_onnx.rs](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/blob/main/crates/burn-import/onnx-tests/tests/test_onnx.rs).
   Further details can be found in the
   [onnx-tests README](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/blob/main/crates/burn-import/onnx-tests/README.md).

## Implementing a New Operator

To extend the capabilities of the Burn library by supporting new operations imported from ONNX
graphs, developers must go through a few systematic steps. Here, we detail the process, using the
implementation of the `Squeeze` operation to illustrate points as needed. All file/directory paths
are relative to the root of the burn repository.

### Step 1: Node Processor Implementation in onnx-ir

The `onnx-ir` crate handles the Intermediate Representation (IR) of ONNX models using a
processor-based architecture. For each operation:

1. Add the operation to the `NodeType` enum in `crates/onnx-ir/src/ir.rs`.

2. Create a new module file in `crates/onnx-ir/src/node/<operation_name>.rs`. This file should
   implement the `NodeProcessor` trait which handles:
   - **Configuration extraction**: Extract operation parameters from ONNX node attributes
   - **Type inference**: Infer output types (including element type, rank, and optionally static
     shapes) from input types and configuration
   - **Opset validation**: Ensure the node is compatible with the model's opset version

3. Make the module visible in `crates/onnx-ir/src/node/mod.rs`.

4. Register your processor in `crates/onnx-ir/src/registry.rs` by adding it to the
   `with_standard_processors()` function.

For example, the squeeze operation is defined in `crates/onnx-ir/src/node/squeeze.rs` and contains:

- A `SqueezeProcessor` struct that implements `NodeProcessor`
- The `extract_config` method extracts axes from node attributes
- The `infer_types` method updates output type by reducing input rank based on squeezed axes

### Step 2: Node Implementation in burn-import

1. Create a new file named `<operation_name>.rs` in the `crates/burn-import/src/burn/node/`
   directory. This file will define the structure and functionality of your new operation. By
   convention, the necessary information for carrying out an operation is encapsulated within a
   struct named `<operation>Node`. For the `Squeeze` operation, we defined a struct called
   `SqueezeNode` that holds necessary information about the input tensor, output tensor, and axes
   for the operation.

2. Implement the `OnnxIntoNode` trait for your node. This trait has a single method `from_onnx` that
   converts an ONNX IR node into your Burn node type:

   ```rust
   impl OnnxIntoNode for SqueezeNode {
       fn from_onnx(node: onnx_ir::Node) -> Self {
           let input = TensorType::from(node.inputs.first().unwrap());
           let output = TensorType::from(node.outputs.first().unwrap());
           let axes = squeeze_config(&node);

           SqueezeNode::new(input, output, axes)
       }
   }
   ```

3. The core of integrating a new operation involves implementing the `NodeCodegen` trait for your
   node. This trait defines how the node generates code during the graph compilation process. The
   implementation must provide methods to define input and output types, to generate the forward
   pass code, and to encapsulate the node into the more general `Node` structure. Specifically:
   - `input_types()` - Returns the types of all input arguments
   - `output_types()` - Returns the types of all output values
   - `forward()` - Generates the Rust code that performs the operation during execution. Use the
     `quote!` macro to generate code and ensure it's syntactically correct Burn code
   - `into_node()` - Wraps the node into the general `Node<PS>` enum

   Example implementation:

   ```rust
   impl<PS: PrecisionSettings> NodeCodegen<PS> for SqueezeNode {
       fn input_types(&self) -> Vec<Type> {
           vec![self.input.clone()]
       }

       fn output_types(&self) -> Vec<Type> {
           vec![self.output.clone()]
       }

       fn forward(&self, scope: &mut Scope, node_position: usize) -> TokenStream {
           // Simplified example - actual implementation handles more cases
           let input = scope.tensor_use_owned(&self.input, node_position);
           let output = &self.output.name();

           match &self.axes {
               Some(axes) => {
                   let axes_tokens = axes.to_tokens();
                   quote! {
                       let #output = #input.squeeze_dims(&#axes_tokens);
                   }
               }
               None => {
                   let output_rank = self.output.rank();
                   quote! {
                       let #output = #input.squeeze::<#output_rank>();
                   }
               }
           }
       }

       fn into_node(self) -> Node<PS> {
           Node::Squeeze(self)
       }
   }
   ```

4. Add unit tests in the same file to verify the generated code compiles and works correctly. These
   tests typically call a helper function like `assert_tokens()` to validate the generated code
   against expected output.

### Step 3: Register in Module System

Add the module declaration to `crates/burn-import/src/burn/node/mod.rs`:

```rust
// ... other node modules
pub(crate) mod squeeze;
// ... more node modules
```

The modules are automatically made visible through re-exports in the same file.

### Step 4: Register in Node Registry

Add your operation to the node registry in `crates/burn-import/src/burn/node_registry.rs`. This is
the **single source of truth** for all ONNX node conversions.

For a single ONNX operation mapping to a single node type:

```rust
node_registry! {
    // ... other operations
    Squeeze => squeeze as SqueezeNode,
    // ... more operations
}
```

For multiple ONNX operations mapping to the same node type (e.g., various reduce operations):

```rust
node_registry! {
    // ... other operations
    [ReduceMax, ReduceMin, ReduceMean, ReduceProd, ReduceSum]
        => ReduceMax: reduce as ReduceNode,
    // ... more operations
}
```

That's it! The registry automatically generates:

- The `Node<PS>` enum with your operation as a variant
- The `match_all!` macro for dispatching
- The ONNX to Burn conversion logic
- All necessary imports

### Step 5: Type Inference Implementation

Type inference in onnx-ir is handled by the `NodeProcessor` trait's `infer_types` method. This
method infers output types (element type, rank, and optionally static shapes) based on:

- Input argument types
- Node configuration (extracted from attributes)
- ONNX opset version

Example implementation in your processor:

```rust
fn infer_types(
    &self,
    node: &mut Node,
    opset: usize,
) -> Result<(), ProcessError> {
    // Extract input information
    let input = &node.inputs[0];
    let input_type = input.ty.as_tensor()?;

    // Extract configuration
    let config = self.extract_config(node, opset)?;
    let axes = config.get::<Vec<i64>>("axes")?;

    // Compute output type
    let output_rank = input_type.rank - axes.len();

    // Update output type
    node.outputs[0].ty = ArgType::Tensor(TensorType {
        elem_type: input_type.elem_type.clone(),
        rank: output_rank,
        static_shape: None,
    });

    Ok(())
}
```

The onnx-ir crate provides helper functions for common patterns:

- `same_as_input()` - Output has same type as input
- `broadcast_shapes()` - Compute broadcasted shape for binary operations
- `infer_shape_from_outputs()` - For operations with runtime-determined shapes

### Step 6: Add Newly Supported Op!

As a reward, add an extra check to `crates/burn-import/SUPPORTED-ONNX-OPS.md`!

### Constant Lifting

The onnx-ir pipeline automatically handles constant lifting during the post-processing phase. If
your operation takes inputs from constant nodes (such as weights in Conv1d, shape tensors in
Reshape, etc.), the constants are automatically lifted and made available through the
`Argument::value()` method.

"Lifting" constants means making constant values directly accessible on node inputs. For example,
instead of requiring a separate graph traversal to find a Constant node, you can call
`node.inputs[1].value()` to access the constant tensor data directly.

To use constant values in your processor:

```rust
fn extract_config(
    &self,
    node: &Node,
    _opset: usize,
) -> Result<NodeConfig, ProcessError> {
    let mut config = NodeConfig::new();

    // Access constant input (e.g., shape tensor)
    if let Some(shape_tensor) = node.inputs.get(1).and_then(|arg| arg.value()) {
        let shape_values = shape_tensor.to_vec::<i64>()?;
        config.set("target_shape", shape_values);
    }

    Ok(config)
}
```

The constant lifting happens automatically for nodes that request constant values, so you don't need
to register your node type anywhere. The pipeline intelligently lifts constants only when needed
during the post-processing phase.

## Architecture Overview

### ONNX-IR Pipeline

The `onnx-ir` crate converts ONNX models to an Intermediate Representation through a 5-phase
pipeline:

#### Phase 1: Initialization

- Creates `GraphState` from ONNX proto structures
- **Constants-first approach**: Converts all ONNX initializers into Constant nodes, providing a
  uniform starting point for processing
- Sets up the value store for tensor data using `burn_tensor::TensorData`
- Preserves sanitized graph input names for debugging

#### Phase 2: Node Conversion

- Converts ONNX nodes to IR nodes using `convert_node_proto()`
- **Opset-aware**: Extracts node configuration using registered processors that accept opset
  parameters for version-specific behavior
- Handles constant nodes specially (extracting values from attributes into tensor store)

#### Phase 3: Type Inference

- Iteratively infers types for all nodes using processor implementations
- Supports preference propagation (e.g., Concat can request Shape types from producers)
- Continues until convergence (no more type changes) or max iterations

#### Phase 4: Post-processing

- Lifts constants: Makes constant values accessible on downstream node inputs
- Eliminates Identity nodes: Removes no-op nodes and rewires the graph
- Re-runs constant lifting after Identity elimination

#### Phase 5: Finalization

- Removes unreferenced constant nodes
- Constructs the final `OnnxGraph` with inputs, outputs, and nodes

### NodeProcessor Trait

The `NodeProcessor` trait is the core abstraction for handling ONNX operations in onnx-ir,
representing the **simplified op model** that makes the crate more scalable and maintainable. Each
processor is self-contained and implements three key methods:

```rust
pub trait NodeProcessor {
    /// Extract configuration from node attributes
    fn extract_config(
        &self,
        node: &Node,
        opset: usize,
    ) -> Result<NodeConfig, ProcessError>;

    /// Infer output types from inputs and configuration
    fn infer_types(
        &self,
        node: &mut Node,
        opset: usize,
    ) -> Result<(), ProcessError>;

    /// Optionally request specific types from producers (e.g., Shape instead of Tensor)
    fn request_producer_types(
        &self,
        _node: &Node,
    ) -> Option<HashMap<String, Vec<RequestedType>>> {
        None
    }
}
```

Key design principles:

- **Separation of concerns**: Configuration extraction is separate from type inference
- **Error handling**: All methods return `Result` for proper error propagation
- **Opset awareness**: Methods receive opset version for version-specific behavior
- **Type preferences**: Nodes can request specific types from their inputs (e.g., requesting Shape
  type for dynamic operations)

## Testing

When implementing a new operator, there are several levels of testing to consider:

### Unit Testing

- **Processor Configuration**: Write unit tests for the `extract_config` method in
  `crates/onnx-ir/src/node/<operation_name>.rs` to verify that it correctly extracts parameters from
  ONNX nodes. Test with various attribute combinations and edge cases.

- **Type Inference**: Test the `infer_types` method to ensure it correctly computes output types
  (element type, rank, and static shapes when applicable). Verify behavior with different input
  types and configurations.

- **Opset Validation**: Test that the processor correctly validates or rejects nodes based on opset
  version requirements.

- **Code Generation**: Test the Node implementation in `burn-import` to verify that it generates
  correct Rust code. Each node file typically includes a `test_codegen_nodes()` function that uses
  `assert_tokens()` to validate generated code.

### Integration Testing

- Create small ONNX models that use your operator and test the end-to-end conversion process
- Ensure the generated Rust code compiles and produces the expected outputs
- Add these tests to `crates/burn-import/onnx-tests/tests/test_onnx.rs`

### End-to-End Testing

- Test with realistic ONNX models that use your operator in conjunction with others
- Verify that inputs and outputs match between the original ONNX model and the converted Burn model
- Include models that test edge cases (e.g., different input shapes, parameter combinations)

Testing both type inference and configuration extraction is particularly important as these
components directly affect the correctness of the conversion process. Incorrect type inference can
lead to mismatched tensor shapes or wrong element types, while incorrect configuration can cause
runtime errors or produce incorrect results.
